This is my shiny app for my first homework on PA municipal public finance data.
This Data Set was cleaned and merged using the following sources:
1. Municipal Data: [PA Department of Community & Economic Development](http://munstats.pa.gov/Reports/ReportInformation2.aspx?report=StatewideMuniAfr)
2. Municipal Names: [Census Shapefile](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php)

To get accurate municipal names and its corresponding counties, I have to refer to census data
